#### Techonologies
In these first two topics we have gone over a number of technologies that are necessary for web developers. To recap, these have included:

- Text Documents
- Text Editors
- GIT VCS and GUI App
- GitHub.com

This is in addition to the Topic-01 discussion and examination of the Internet and what a web developer is/does.

#### Languages
If you've practiced, you should have a firm grasp on Markdown, and a basic grip on HTML. Both are required to complete Project 1 (and all projects going forward).

1. Created your course directory on your local harddrive.
2. Synched this directory to your GitHub.com account.
