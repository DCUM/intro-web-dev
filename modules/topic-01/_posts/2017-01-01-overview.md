# Topic 01: <br /> Internetting Pt. 1
This topic is all about the internet, what it is, and what it _isn't._ You'll also get a chance to explore the GitHub Issues board and Project panel that we'll be using for this course.

Your first project introduces the class and its tools (GitHub), as well as the (in)tangibility of the internet and world wide web.

_Duration: 2 Modules/Weeks_


# Topic Goals
By the end of this Topic, we hope you:

1. Have some idea what the internet is and _is not_, and be able to articulate these opinions.
2. Understand what web development is and _is not_, and keep it in mind going forward.
3. Use the GitHub Issues board to post a reply to a live issue.
